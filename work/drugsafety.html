		<h2>Problem</h2>
		<p>If you've ever taken a prescription drug, you might know that if you squint at the label you'll find some warnings about possible adverse side effects. When these side effects occur, they have to be reported to medical care providers and pharma companies, so they can monitor this data and be handled appropriately by the risk management teams. The teams that process and monitor these data are called PharmacoVigilance teams. Cognizant historically has provided case processing as a service to pharmacompanies to help manage the volume of cases coming in. Leaders on this team identified some major issues and inefficiencies happening in this space, causing data issues and leading to major consequences downstream for pharma companies: safety failure in clinital trials, lawsuits, opportunity loss, and reputation damage. Team T at the accelerator was tasked with creating a new software platform to help fix these issues upstream.

		<h2>Process</h2>
    <h3>Problem Validation</h3>
    <p>Although we had a good amount of subject matter expertise informing our product direction, we wanted to validate these issues with additional experts to add depth to our team's assumptions. We conducted interviews with 8 internal experts. The focus of these conversations was to understand how Pharmacovigilance professionals are working today, with what tools, and what the greatest pain points are in their current workflows.</p> 
    
    <ul>
    <p>The major themes were:</p>
    <li>The workflow between Quality Reviewers and Case Processors has a lot of potential to be growth focused and smooth, but it currently can be negative and clunky. This can lead to unhappiness, a loss of productivity, or even turnover.</li>
    <li>The sense of support is very present among associates working on clients who are present in the same location, which makes them feel happy and motivated. We have an opportunity to design for that same sense of teamwork even for clients with distributed associates.</li>
    <li>Clients have incredibly high expections from Quality Review associates, but both the issues with data quality upfront, and issues with the clients’ processes themselves, can be barriers to getting work done as well as possible.</li>
    <li>The manual logging of errors and corresponding with associates to fix them is frustratingly inefficient. Everyone sees it, but they don’t have a way to fix it.</li>
    <li>Users want a tool that puts all of their work in one platform, and solves for the inefficiency in their job. This will not only make them happy, but increase their efficiency, thereby enabling customers of this tool to see even more of a savings than automation alone could provide.</li>
    </ul>

		<h3>Inception</h3>
		<p>As with all projects at Accelerator, we kicked off with a milestone called “inception”. This is where all clients, PM’s designers, and developers working on the project get together for a day and develop the idea, as well as scope the MVP. What was wonderful about this particular inception was that for the first time, the Accelerator invested in upfront user research, so we were able to have a productive discussion about users with data to drive consensus. The first thing we did during inception was to sketch out our user types. Although the UX team was all on the same page about who these work, persona sketching was used as an exercuse to get stakeholders interacting with the research and in alignment with what their goals from our product would be.
 </p>
 
 <p>Based on an understanding of some of our user’s needs, we brainstormed all the possible features that could built given no time constraints and no budget.

	<p>We did a few other activities like this to help flesh out what this product would be. We came out of inception with personas, flows, sketches, and a feature list for MVP. While this isn’t the most robust design thinking application ever conceived, it’s a great way to quickly get a product from a seedling of an idea, to a starter plant in the ground.

		<h3>Discovery & Prototyping</h3>
		<p>This was a small project team, which included myself, a designer, and an architect. The architect worked validate some of the technical feasibility for these products, while the designer and I worked to sketch out flows that addressed the features we'd prioritized for our first version. </p>

		<p>Side note - the designer I worked with was a developer in a past life, so we decided to experiment with sketching out the prototype's design and then going straight to coding a clickable prototype using our design system, Bonsai (which is a fork of IBM's Carbon.) This worked really well, we were able to simulate super realistic interactions on the prototype, and as a result, the feedback wasn't around content or bugs, but on the product ideas itself, which is exactly what we were looking for at this phase.</p>
