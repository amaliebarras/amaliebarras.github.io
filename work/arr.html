		<h2>Why this project?</h2>
		<p>Austin Resource Recovery wants to increase the city's <b>diversion rate</b>, the rate at which recyclable and compostable materials are thrown into the landfill. They know that since 2015, the diversion rate has stagnated at about 42%, which has them way behind their goal of reaching 90% diversion (or zero-waste) by 2040. Through years of quantitative research, ARR realized that they can track and measure "the what" and try different things, but until they understand "the why", they're just taking shots in the dark.

		<h2>Skills and Tools Used</h2>
		<p>I jumped into this project part of the way through synthesis. My team went out into the field and interviewed 48 different Austin residents in their homes about their behaviors, perceptions, and obstacles to recycling in Austin. You can read more about their research <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1h7yUJL74THaE1HYjJWQUlzRlU/view">here</a> and watch interview clips from a couple of the interviews <a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B0ZCxe9t4WXDS2t6WXpmZkF1dnc?usp=sharing">here.</a>
		<h3>Synthesis</h3>
		<p>Nobody has the time to listen to all 52 of the 90-minute interviews we recorded, so we start with a process called debriefing. In this process one person documents all the observations, key quotes, stories, and takeaways on stickie notes and color codes them. The stickie notes start out on a tool called "participant canvasses" and used initially for a storytelling activity for each resident, but they quickly are moved into groupings as patterns emerge during storytelling. Pattern finding can be a long process, but once the patterns start to take shape, we can begin this process: </p>
		<h6><ul>
			<li>Gave the grouping an obvious label to summarize the main idea of the grouping.</li>
			<li>Asked why to unpack the reason this is happening.</li>
			<li>Wrote an insight, a provocative statement of truth formed in response to the question.</li>
			<li>Created an opportunity area using a “How Might We” statement to transform the insight into prompts for design.</li>
		</ul></h6>
		<h3>Framework</h3>
		<p>What emerged from all of these insights was that a resident's varying levels of recycling knowledge, system ability, and motivation, were the primary levers on whether or not a resident would be a recycler. The pattern that tested across all interviews was that residents need 2 out of 3 framework areas to act.</p>
		<h3>Concepting</h3>
		<p>Once we landed on the "How Might We" statements, we could begin designing for them. We hosted concepting sessions both with the <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1h7yUJL74THaE1HYjJWQUlzRlU/view?usp=sharing"> internal team</a> after the research shareout, and with the local design community at an <a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mZyNrdGNbW6mr3X_x9rlvBeVvUIKucYgg79w6Wl-MiU/edit">Austin Design Week</a> workshop. When all was said and done, we ended up with over 200 concepts, and needed a way to narrow it down.
		<h3>Evaluation</h3>
		<p> We used the research framework to identify which concepts had the greatest potential value. The design team went through and rated each concept along each of the criteria, and pulled out the top 25 with the highest scores. Then we went over these ideas with our stakeholders to evaluate the feasibility with respect to time, budget, and political obstacles. In the end, we decided to shoot for 8 prototypes in 8 weeks.
		</p>
		<h3>Prototyping</h3>
		<p>We used a sprint schedule to keep us on target to this aggressive goal. At the beginning of each sprint, we worked together to develop a problem statement to make sure we were all on the same page with respect to whether a prototype succeeds/fails. This was part of a document called a prototype plan, which also included hypotheses, user scenarios, and field testing steps. If possible, we always tried to start with a paper prototype, because it is often a sufficient enough way to test a concept early, and if it fails, fail fast. </p>

		<p>One example of this is the Outreach Tool. We tested a paper tool which allowed residents to rank themselves on knowledge, ability, and motivation.

		<h2>What I Learned</h2>
		<p>I learned an enormous amount during this project, but the thing that will stick with me forever is the value of qualitative research. I wrote a whole post about this <a href = "https://medium.com/civiqueso/the-harmony-of-qualitative-and-quantitative-research-80d0bebc4fec">on medium.</a> Here's a small excerpt </p>
		<h6><i>When you have qualitative depth of 48 people, you can decide what behavior you care to verify, and how to collect a representative sample for a population of 800,000. If you can develop strong discoveries through synthesis you can form strong hypotheses to test in this sample. And, as an analyst, when you understand the many layers, contradictions, misunderstandings of quantitative data to represent human behavior, you can empathize with your data points, see your dataset for what it is, and ask it the right questions.</i></h6>
