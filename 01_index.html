			<h3>sweet, you found me! </h3>
			<p>I am a student at <a href = "https://www.theironyard.com/">the Iron Yard</a> in Austin, TX. I use data and design to create experiences that empower users to make discoveries and find insights.
			<br><br>
			I love data because it helps me to understand the world around me better, which helps me to understand myself better. I'm happier when I understand myself. I think we all are. 
			<br><br>
			I spend a lot of my free time learning new stuff and being around rockstar people at workshops, hackathons, and meetups, and I currently serve as membership lead for the local <a hred = "https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/">Code for America</a> brigade, <a href = "https://www.open-austin.org">Open Austin.</a>
			<br><br>
			When Iâ€™m not working, I like to drink coffee and learn about humans, with some shopping, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slacklining">slacklining</a>, bouldering, and sleeping in tents sprinkled in. 
			<br><br>
			Also, dad jokes.</p>
