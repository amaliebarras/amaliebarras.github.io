			<h3>yay, you found me </h3>
			<p>I am a student at <a href = "https://www.theironyard.com/">the Iron Yard</a> in Austin, TX. I use data and design to create smooth experiences that empower users to make discoveries and find insights. 
			<br><br>
			I spend a lot of my free time learning new stuff and being around awesome people at workshops, hackathons, and meetups, and I currently serve as membership lead for the local <a hred = "https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/">Code for America</a> brigade, <a href = "https://www.open-austin.org">Open Austin.</a>
			<br><br>
			When Iâ€™m not working, I like to drink coffee and learn about humans, with some urban hiking, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slacklining">slacklining</a>, rock climbing, and sleeping in tents sprinkled in. 
			<br><br>
			I laugh at my own jokes. Most of them are dad jokes. 
			<br><br>
			And I usually smile a lot.</p>
