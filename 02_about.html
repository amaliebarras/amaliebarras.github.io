				<h3>I was a data analyst.</h3>

	<p>I was good at it, too. I love data because it helps us to understand the truth in the world around us. I could have analyzed data and delivered reports for my whole life and it would have been…y’know…fine, but after a few rounds of battling context loss as my reports went up the chain of command, I realized that in order for these numbers to retain meaning, I needed to create tools to empower others to truly champion their own insights.</p>

	<p>As many folks do, I got my start in software by automating my job, specifically building self-service tools for stakeholders. Along the way, I started reading about the UX process and practicing design outside of work via online classes and code for america brigade projects. I quickly decided that after my dashboard project was over, what I needed to do was pivot my career, get formally trained in design, and start on my path toward designing data experiences for users.</p>

	<p>My first design job had me mostly researching and creating and testing prototypes. I learned the value of and became a champion of the harmony of quantitative and qualitative research. I deepened my skills in prototyping and realized there is value in doing it all.</p>

	<h3>Now, I am a designer. I frame problems with research and testing, and create and optimize solutions with iterative, agile methods.</h3>

			<p>When I’m not doing tech stuff, I like to drink coffee, play yahtzee, and sing karaoke, but I also enjoy a fair amount of slacklining, climbing, yoga, and sleeping in tents. </p>
