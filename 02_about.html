			<p>I am a data analyst and web designer in Austin, TX. I use data and design to create experiences that empower users to make discoveries and find insights. I love data because it helps me to understand the world around me better. And when we understand the world, we can make it better. </p>

			<p>I worked as an analyst for three years when I fell in love with design. I fell in love with the process of deeply understanding user needs, creating prototypes, testing how the data were being interpreted, and understanding how users would make decisions based on this data.</p>

			<p>I spend a lot of my free time learning new stuff with great folks at workshops, hackathons, and meetups, and I currently serve as membership lead for the local <a href = "www.codeforamerica.org">Code for America</a> brigade, <a href = "www.open-austin.org">Open Austin.</a> </p>

			<p>When Iâ€™m not working, I like to drink coffee, watch people, and go shopping, but I balance that city-gal stuff with a fair amount of slacklining, climbing, and sleeping in tents. </p>
