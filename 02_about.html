				<h3>I love data because it helps us to understand the truth in the world around us. </h3>
				
				<p>Knowing this, I started my career as a data analyst. I loved it, actually. I could have analyzed data and delivered reports for my whole life and it would have been great, but I started to notice that my work was losing context and impact, the more it was handed off. I realized that data alone wouldn't change the world, it would require a new skill to translate that data into behavior change. Over time I began to realize that they had a word for this process -- <b>design.</b></p> 
				
				<p>After exploring a few different areas of design on my own and then doubling down on my design education, I was eager to apply these skills to yummy social and community challenges. I did so though projects in our local Code for America brigade, and then served as a research-focused UX Designer in the Design, Tech, and Innovation Fellows program at the City of Austin.</p> 
					
				<p>I came to Boulder, Colorado in 2017 and I now work as a UX Designer & Researcher at an accelerator inside Cognizant, bringing ideas to life by defining and designing software MVPs.</p>

	<h3>I frame problems with research and testing, and design and optimize solutions with iterative, agile methods.</h3>

			<p>When Iâ€™m not doing tech stuff, I like to drink coffee, sing karaoke, and play board games with homies, but I also enjoy a fair amount of hiking, dog parking, and traveling to different places. </p>
