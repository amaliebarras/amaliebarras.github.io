			<p>I am a data analyst and web designer in Austin, TX. I'm currently seeking opportunities where I can use data and design to create experiences that empower users to make their own discoveries. I love data because it helps me to understand the world around me better. And the more we understand about the world, the more we can make better. </p>

			<p>I worked as an analyst at EA for three years when I fell in love with design. I fell in love with the process of deeply understanding user needs, creating prototypes, testing how data were being interpreted, and understanding how users would make decisions based on this data. I completed a 12-week design program at the Iron Yard, learning new skills, tools, and completing some really neat <a href = "../">projects</a> along the way. </p>

			<p>I spend a lot of my free time learning new stuff with great folks at workshops, hackathons, and meetups, and I currently serve as membership lead for the local <a href = "www.codeforamerica.org">Code for America</a> brigade, <a href = "www.open-austin.org">Open Austin.</a> </p>

			<p>When Iâ€™m not working, I like to drink coffee, watch people, and go shopping, but I balance that city-gal stuff with a fair amount of slacklining, climbing, and sleeping in tents. </p>
