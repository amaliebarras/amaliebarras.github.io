#Good to be back!

It's been a nice month off, but I'm super happy to be back in a routine, productive and learning every day.

##Highs:

###Eating breakfast, bringing lunch, and biking

I feel healthier than I have in a while, did a lot of beer drinking and boredom eating during my month off :P 

###Making progress and working till I can't anymore

The days are long, but they go by super quickly because I'm so into what I'm doing

##Lows: 

###Being unable to see on the first & second day

I've been showing up early the last couple days though, which has been good not only for getting in front row, but also just finishing things up with a fresh mind, and being ready to go when instruction starts 


###Biking home

When I bike home at night, I just feel super unsafe. Biking on congress the whole way is terrifying during rush hour because it's downhill and traffic moves super fast. Taking East Side Drive to Live Oak is only slightly better :/ I bought some lights which should help with feeling safe, and I also am going to explore other routes through Travis Heights.

###Overall momentum: 
Strong

###Coolest thing I've learned: 

Most of this week has been a review, but I feel like I have a much better understanding of the Box Model, CSS selectors, and also my own ability to problem solve by clearing my head, asking myself "what am I trying to do" and solving the problem with the info I already know.
