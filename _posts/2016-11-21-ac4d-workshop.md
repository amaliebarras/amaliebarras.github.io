title: What's the word for that?

## Update!

If you didn't already know, I recently made the move to Boulder, CO from Austin. My boyfriend [Alex](http://twitter.com/flexyford) landed a great job with a cool company called [FitBot](http://twitter.com/FitBot), and they were able to relocate both of us. I'm excited to start a new chapter in a new place. This change, however, means I have to make job search moves again, and I find myself here in the between.

## What's Next

What I would like to find is a role where I can design and code. I will never stop being a data enthusiast and never stop working with data, but from what I've observed, my focus on leveraging my quantitative past is totally trapping me in it.

I really really like to code. I love having the power to bring my designs to life, share them on GitHub, and collaborate with developers on projects. It makes me very happy to spend my days in Sketch, Atom, and iTerm, and I want to find a role that will let me do what I love.

## The Challenge
I'm not an expert in JavaScript. I'm not even intermediate at it. Although I have worked closely with devs on various projects including PANDA, WeSpeakToo and the Open Austin website, I myself am a beginner JavaScript coder at best. I do *want* to learn more, I even think I could make a great designer / developer one day, but I'm not one right now. And it's hard to market yourself as something you just *want* to be.

I do know HTML and CSS, and Markdown. And use Git and GitHub. And randomly, from a past life, SQL. But what the hell do you call "a person who codes in a few languages who isn't really a programmer, engineer, or data scientist." And don't say "developer", because every job description out there with developer expects you to know React or Angular or Ember or Rails or Java.

## What I Do Know

The market here is different than Austin. A couple of difference I've noticed is that nobody uses the term "product designer." This is important to know, because that's my go to search word, since those roles typically call for a well-rounded designer with technical skills, which is exactly what I'm looking for. Another difference I noticed is the role called "UX Engineer". This is a person who programs in a framework and has strong design chops too. It's like me in ... 3 years maybe. Wishfully.


## Wrap-Up

This post is full of questions and deft of answers because that's what I've got now! I do know that I'm learning as I go and filling these spaces in. I'm excited to write again soon and let you know what's worked and how I've decided to go forward. 


More on that soon!
