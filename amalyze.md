I've been collecting data on myself for the entire month of April with an app called [reporter.](http://www.reporter-app.com/)

It was created by one of my design heros, [Nick Felton](http://feltron.com/) who is popular for his annual reports using quantified self data. The app allows you to choose your questions and set alert times for creating "reports." I've created mine at 10PM every night, and I answer the following questions: 

- How many coffees did you have today?
- How many minutes did you spend outside today?
- How many minutes did you spend with friends today? 
- How many minutes did you listen to music today? 
- How many minutes did you listen to podcasts today? 
- How many minutes of TV did you watch today? 
- Did you eat at a restaurant today? 
- Did you try a new place? 
- Do you feel healthy? 
- How many hours did you work today? 
- Did you spend time with boyfriend today?
- Did you help someone today?
- Rate your happiness 1 - 10

I also have data from the Health app with steps, call log data from my phone, & bank transaction data if I feel like additional variables are necessary. 

I want to take this data and tell my mid-bootcamp story, but unlike him I want it to be in webpage format. I'd like to try to use [d3](https://d3js.org/) but if it starts taking too long I'll use [tableau](http://www.tableau.com/) to help w/ content and [raw](http://raw.densitydesign.org/) to turn formatted data into svg's to style w/ the site.
